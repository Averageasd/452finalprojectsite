        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is a very ambitious project that combines RTS concepts with VR. As a main player in this game, we are in
            charge of small-sized army
            that contains 20 ranged soldiers. Our main job, as a player, is very simple: Defend the castles and defeat
            all
            enemies. The game is simple to learn,
            but hard to master. We can determine the outcome of the game. To secure final victory, we have to master the
            art
            of using the allied solders. These soldiers can be easily
            killed by enemies if each of them is isolated from the group. Moreover, their damage and health are low. It
            is
            very important to keep track of our soldiers and
            constantly put them in safe spots instead of letting them to get to close to the enemies, who are agile,
            highly
            durable and have an ability to do AOE damage.
